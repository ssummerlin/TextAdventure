 * The OmniDoor is a door whose lock is a set of 5 pins. Each pin
 * is either up or down. The OmniDoor can only be opened by an
 * OmniKey who's pins are configured the same as the OmniDoor's pins.

 * If a player tries to open an OmniDoor with an OmniKey and the key is
 * improperly configured, the OmniDoor will randomize its pins.
 *
 * The OmniDoor does have one redeeming quality: you can ask the door
 * to give you a key's first incorrect pin without any consequence.
