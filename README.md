# Text Adventure Project

Welcome to the Text Adventure Project! This is for Unit 1 of the Backend Development course and is intended to ensure that you have a good handle on the Java fundamentals that you will need for future units. 

You can find instructions for each assignment by going to the Sprint Activities found in Canvas. You will be graded on your code's ability to successfully pass each test and your code's readability (based on a lint checker). As you work on your assignment, I strongly recommend you run the tests and lint checker regularly to make sure you are on track.

You can run tests inside of IntelliJ by opening the desired test file and clicking on the run icon to the left of the code.

You can also run tests in your terminal. Here's an example test command:

```
./gradlew test --tests com.adventure.MT1
```

To run the lint checker (verifies that your coding **style** follows best practice), you can do so in your terminal by running the following:

```
./gradlew checkstyleMain 
```

If you have any infractions after running the lint checker, you'll find a file link in your terminal that you can copy and paste into your browser for more details.

### Issues

If you find any issues with the codebase, please feel free to reach out to your instructor for assistance. 

Best of luck!
